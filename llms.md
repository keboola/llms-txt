# Work with tables
tables = client.buckets.list_tables('bucket-id')
table = client.tables.create_from_file('bucket-id', 'table-name', 'data.csv')

# Load and export data
client.tables.load(table_id='table-id', file_path='data.csv', is_incremental=True)
client.tables.export_to_file(table_id='table-id', path_name='export.csv')

# Handle files
file_id = client.files.upload_file('file.csv', tags=['tag1'])
